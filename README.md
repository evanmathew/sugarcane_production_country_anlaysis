# Sugarcane Production By Country Analysis

Note: 
1) There is a potential that the graph will not be displayed on github; thus, to examine those charts, try opening them using kaggle; the link will be present at the top of the notebook or just click on this link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/evansajumathew/sugarcane-production-country-anlaysis.
2) I extracted the data using the web scraping approach and began analysing it, so if you want to skip the scraping and focus on the data analysis, I have included the dataset with this jupyter notebook.
